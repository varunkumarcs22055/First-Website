        <p>The future of space exploration involves both telescopic exploration and the physical exploration of space by robotic spacecraft and human spaceflight.
<br><br><br>
            Near-term physical exploration missions, focused on obtaining new information about the solar system, are planned and announced by both national and private organisations. There are tentative plans for crewed orbital and landing missions to the Moon and Mars to establish scientific outposts that will later enable permanent and self-sufficient settlements. Further exploration will potentially involve expedition and the other planets and settlements on the moon as well as establishing mining and fueling outposts, particularly in the asteroid belt. Physical exploration outside the solar System will be robotic for the foreseeable future.

        It has been argued that space colonization is a means of ensuring the survival of human civilization given a planetary disaster. Colonizing other planets allows for the dispersal of humans and thus increases the likelihood of survival given a planetary disaster. Furthermore, the availability of additional resources that can be mined from space could potentially expand the capabilities of humans and largely benefit society. Leveraging these resources and moving high polluting industries to space could reduce the emissions on earth and ultimately lead to finding cleaner energy sources. The primary blockers to colonizing space include technological and economic challenges.[1]

        Many private companies are working to make space travel more efficient in hopes to reduce the overall cost of space travel, and thus space colonization. SpaceX has been a dominant leader in this push for efficient exploration with the release of the Falcon 9, a reusable rocket.[2] NASA's Artemis program aims to land another man and the first woman on the moon by 2024 and eventually establish sustainable space travel by 2028. The Artemis program is NASA's stepping stone to their ultimate goal of landing on Mars</p>
